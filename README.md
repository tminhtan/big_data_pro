## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Apache Airflow
- Docker (for running containers)
- Docker Compose (for orchestrating multiple containers)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone 
   cd 
   ```

### Running the Project

1. **Build and run Docker containers**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up airflow-init
   ```
   Up the docker
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

2. **Access Apache Airflow**:

   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to access the Airflow dashboard.

3. **Trigger DAGs**:

   - Navigate to the "DAGs" tab in the Airflow dashboard to see available DAGs.
   - You can manually trigger the data pipeline and model training DAGs from the UI.

## DAG Files Description

### `dags/data_pipeline.py`

This file contains the DAG for the data ingestion and preprocessing pipeline. It orchestrates the data flow from external sources to the data storage locations, including raw and processed directories. It might include tasks such as:

- Extracting data from external sources
- Loading and cleaning the data
- Saving the cleaned data to the processed directory

### `dags/model_training.py`

This DAG is responsible for the model training process. It typically includes tasks such as:

- Loading the preprocessed data
- Training the machine learning model
- Saving the trained model to the designated models directory
- Evaluating the model's performance

### `dags/db_utils.py`

This file contains utility functions for database operations, such as connecting to the database, executing queries, and handling transactions. It is used by other DAGs for tasks that require database interactions, like storing model metrics or configurations.

## Source Code Description

### `src/data/`

- **`make_dataset.py`**: This script is responsible for creating the dataset from raw data. It might include functions to clean, transform, and format the data for model training.
  
- **`data_loader.py`**: This file contains utility functions to load data into memory or from disk. It might handle data batching and preprocessing to prepare data for training and evaluation.

### `src/features/`

- **`build_features.py`**: This script is designed to create features from the raw data. It might include methods for feature engineering, selection, and transformation that are critical for model performance.

### `src/models/`

- **`predict_model.py`**: This file contains functions to make predictions using the trained model. It is typically used for serving predictions in production environments.
  
- **`train_model.py`**: This script is responsible for training the machine learning model using the features created from the dataset. It includes model selection, training loops, and hyperparameter tuning.

- **`model_utils.py`**: This file contains utility functions related to model handling, such as loading and saving models, evaluating performance, and logging results.

### `src/utils/`

- **`file_utils.py`**: This script includes utility functions for file operations, such as reading and writing files, managing file paths, and checking file existence.

- **`logging_utils.py`**: This file sets up logging configurations for the project, ensuring that logs are captured consistently across all scripts.

### `src/visualization/`

- **`visualize.py`**: This script is responsible for creating visualizations to help understand the data and model performance. It may include functions to plot data distributions, training progress, and evaluation metrics.

## Data Organization

- **`data/external/`**: Store external datasets here.
- **`data/processed/`**: Processed datasets can be saved in this directory.
- **`data/raw/`**: Keep raw data files in this directory.

## Custom Plugins

The `plugins/` directory allows you to define custom operators and hooks for Airflow. This helps in extending the functionality of Airflow to fit your specific needs.

## Testing

Unit tests are included in the `tests/` directory. You can run tests using:
